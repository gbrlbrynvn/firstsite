<h1>Simple Website using HTML and CSS</h1>

<h2>Description</h2>
I made a simple website from scratch using HTML and CSS using Visual Studio Code and is hosted via Github. I created this to test my skills and creativity in said languages. I'll further improve this website in the future with Javascript and possibly make it a website for my portfolio.
